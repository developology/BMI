#BMI Calculator


The BMI calculator I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a user-friendly tool that helps individuals determine their body mass index.

The layout and design, created with HTML and CSS, provide a clean and intuitive interface. Users can input their weight and height, and upon clicking the "Check BMI" button, the JavaScript code instantly computes the BMI value.

The result is then displayed on the screen as an alert, along with a corresponding message indicating whether the individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

The calculator's responsive design ensures optimal usability across various devices, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
